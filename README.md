# Mod Introduction
This mod is a Minecraft industrial mod,but currently has only simple elements.

And actually we are promising the moon. ~~(really)~~

The mod provides a set of APIs and an energy system for auxiliary mod to access.


In the future, it will be used as a pre-mod for Threebody Industry (future project).
